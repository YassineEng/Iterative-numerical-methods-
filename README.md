# Iterative-numerical-methods-
Iterative numerical methods for solving partial differential equations. You can find in the Laplace equation with animation notebook an example of solving Laplace equation using Gauss-seidel iterative method. A second order central finite difference scheme has been used to discretize the differential equation.  


You can find in the Laplace equation with animation notebook an example of solving Laplace equation using Jaccobi iterative method, notice the difference in convergence speed by displaying the number of iteration k.
