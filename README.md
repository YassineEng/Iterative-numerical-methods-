# Iterative-numerical-methods-
Iterative numerical methods for solving partial differential equations. You can find in the Laplace equation with animation notebook an example of solving Laplace equation using Gauss-Seidel iterative method. A second order central finite difference scheme has been used to discretize the differential equation.  


You can find in the Laplace equation with animation notebook an example of solving Laplace equation using Jacobi iterative method, notice the difference in convergence speed by displaying the number of iterations k.


You can find in the Laplace equation SOR method notebook an example of solving Laplace equation using successive over relaxation method. A second order central finite difference scheme has been used to discretize the differential equation. You can notice the convergence speed enhancement with respect to Gauss-Seidel method by displaying the number of iterations k.
